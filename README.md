  We ran tests by running our progam over and over again, and constanly changing the code to keep making small ajustments to the game periodically 
  We also had multiple people try and test our game to get different  feedbacks

  For our Dungeon-Crawler game we used a Java
  while in Java we used a method of programing called object oriented programming where we made all the attributes into objects so they could be adjusted  and manipulated easier
